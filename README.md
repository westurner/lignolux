# Sustainable Factory

Modeling sustainable factory processes with Linked Data and MyST Markdown.

## Overview

## Features
- **MyST Markdown Parser**: Extracts process steps and properties.
- **RDF-star Generation**: Exports to Turtle-star with reified metadata.
- **Mermaid Integration**: Visualizes process flows directly from documentation.
- **Sphinx Documentation**: High-quality HTML output with integrated diagrams.
