This research summarizes the optimal open-source path for modeling production processes (Inputs, Processes, Outputs) using Linked Data standards that bridge the gap between semantic richness (RDF) and developer usability (Property Graphs).

### **1. The Schema: Industrial Ontologies Foundry (IOF)**

For modeling production, you should not invent a schema from scratch. The **Industrial Ontologies Foundry (IOF)** provides a standard, BFO-compliant vocabulary specifically designed for manufacturing.

- **Core Ontology:** **IOF Core** (based on **BFO** - Basic Formal Ontology).
- **Modeling Pattern (IPO):**

    - **Input:** Models as `iof:material_resource` or `bfo:continuant` that participates in a process.

    - **Process:** Models as `iof:planned_process` (a temporal entity).

    - **Output:** Models as `iof:product` (the result of the process).

**Why this fits your goal:**
Standard RDF often forces you to create intermediate nodes just to say "Input X entered Process Y _at 10:00 AM_." This creates "node explosion." **RDF-star** solves this by allowing you to attach the timestamp directly to the relationship, just like a Property Graph.

### **2. The Technology: RDF-star & SPARQL-star**

RDF-star (RDF*) allows you to treat a "triple" (a relationship) as a node itself. This enables **Property Graph behavior** within Linked Data.

#### **Conceptual Model**

Instead of just linking `(SteelSheet) -> [fed_into] -> (StampingProcess)`, you can assert properties _about_ that link:

- _Property:_ **Flow Rate** = 10 units/min
- _Property:_ **Timestamp** = 2023-10-27T09:00:00

#### **Syntax Example (Turtle-star)**

```Code snippet
@prefix iof: <https://spec.industrialontologies.org/ontology/core/Core/> .
@prefix ex: <http://example.com/factory/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

# 1. The Production Step (Process)
ex:Step_Stamping_001 a iof:PlannedProcess ;
    rdfs:label "Stamping Chassis" .

# 2. Input with Metadata (RDF-star)
# We state that Steel Sheet is input to the process, AND add metadata to that link
<< ex:Sheet_Batch_99 iof:participates_in_at_some_time ex:Step_Stamping_001 >>
    ex:entryTime "2023-10-27T08:30:00"^^xsd:dateTime ;
    ex:temperature "450"^^xsd:celsius .

# 3. Output
ex:Chassis_Frame_001 a iof:Product ;
    iof:is_output_of ex:Step_Stamping_001 .
```

#### **Querying (SPARQL-star)**

To find inputs processed at high temperatures:

```Code snippet
SELECT ?input ?temp
WHERE {
  # Match the triple AND its metadata
  << ?input iof:participates_in_at_some_time ?process >> ex:temperature ?temp .
  
  FILTER (?temp > 400)
}
```

### **3. Open Source Tooling Stack**

To implement this _specifically_ with open-source tools that support the "star" extensions:

| Component | Recommended Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Database (Triplestore) | Apache Jena (Fuseki) | Full support for RDF-star and SPARQL-star. Mature, purely open-source (Apache 2.0). |
| Alt. Database | RDF4J | The other major Java-based open-source framework. Excellent documentation for RDF-star. |
| Programming Lib | Oxigraph | A newer, high-performance graph store written in Rust. Great for Python bindings if you are building data pipelines. |
| Visualization | GraphDB (Free Edition) | While the enterprise version is paid, the free version handles RDF-star visualization very well out-of-the-box. |
| Ontology Editor | Protégé | Note: Protégé does not natively support RDF-star visualization well yet. You will likely need to write the .ttls (Turtle-star) files manually or use code (Jena/RDF4J) to populate the data. |Export to Sheets

### **Summary of Recommendation**

1. **Schema:** adopt **IOF Core** to align with industry standards for "Process" and "Product."
2. **Graph Model:** Use **RDF-star** to model the _inputs_ and _outputs_ as edges with properties (Time, Amount, State) to avoid creating intermediate "Association Classes."
3. **Stack:** Run **Apache Jena Fuseki** as your server. Use Python (with `rdflib` or `oxigraph`) to ingest your production logs into Turtle-star format.

**Would you like me to generate a Python script using `rdflib` that converts a sample CSV of production logs into this RDF-star format?**
